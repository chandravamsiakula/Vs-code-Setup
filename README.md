Visual Studio Code Layout for Java Development

This project follows a structured Visual Studio Code layout optimized specifically for Java programming.

The workspace is divided into three functional sections to improve clarity and productivity:

Left Panel – Java Code Editor
The left side is dedicated to writing and editing Java source files. This area is used to implement logic, define classes, and manage methods without interference from execution details.

Top Right Panel – Input Area
The top-right section is used to provide input for Java programs. It allows developers to easily modify test cases and simulate different input scenarios while keeping the code unchanged.

Bottom Right Panel – Output Area
The bottom-right section displays the output produced by the Java program. Keeping output separate from input helps in quickly validating results and debugging logic errors.

This layout enables developers to view Java code, input, and output simultaneously, reducing the need to switch between tabs or windows. It is especially useful for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms, solving coding problems, and testing Java programs with multiple inputs.

The organized structure supports a smooth development workflow and enhances focus during Java coding and debugging.
